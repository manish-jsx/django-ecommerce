## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x**: This project is developed using Python, so you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Django**: Django is a high-level Python web framework used to build web applications, including e-commerce platforms. Install Django using `pip`, the Python package manager:

   ```bash
   pip install Django
   ```

3. **Database Management System**: E-commerce applications typically rely on databases to store product information, user data, and more. You can choose from various database systems supported by Django, such as:

   - **SQLite**: Included with Django by default for development purposes.
   - **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source database.
   - **MySQL**: Another popular open-source relational database.
   - **Oracle Database**: If your project has enterprise-level requirements.

   Install the appropriate database system and configure it according to your project's needs. Make sure to update the database settings in your Django project's settings file (`settings.py`).

4. **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**: It's a best practice to create a virtual environment for your project to manage its dependencies separately. You can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `venv`:

   ```bash
   # Using virtualenv
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

   # Using venv (Python 3.3+)
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

5. **Additional Python Packages**: Depending on the specific requirements of your e-commerce project, you may need to install additional Python packages. Common packages include:

   - **Pillow**: For handling image uploads and manipulation.

     ```bash
     pip install Pillow
     ```

   - **Django Allauth**: If you want to implement user authentication and account management.

     ```bash
     pip install django-allauth
     ```

   - **Django Rest Framework**: If you plan to build a RESTful API for your e-commerce platform.

     ```bash
     pip install djangorestframework
     ```

6. **Web Server (Production Environment)**: In a production environment, you'll need a web server to serve your Django application. Popular choices include:

   - **Gunicorn**: A WSGI HTTP server for running Django applications.

     ```bash
     pip install gunicorn
     ```

   - **uWSGI**: Another WSGI server that can serve Django applications.

     ```bash
     pip install uwsgi
     ```

7. **Nginx or Apache (Production Environment)**: To serve as a reverse proxy and handle incoming HTTP requests in a production environment, you can use Nginx or Apache.

   - **Nginx**: Install and configure Nginx to work with your Gunicorn or uWSGI server.

     ```bash
     # Install Nginx
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install nginx
     ```

   - **Apache**: Install and configure Apache to work with your WSGI server (e.g., mod_wsgi for Apache).

     ```bash
     # Install Apache and mod_wsgi
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
     ```

8. **E-commerce-Specific Dependencies**: Depending on the specific features of your e-commerce platform, you may need to install additional packages related to payment processing, shipping integration, or other e-commerce services. Some common e-commerce-related libraries include:

   - **Stripe** or **PayPal SDK**: for payment processing.
   - **Shippo** or **FedEx API**: for shipping integration.
   - **E-commerce specific Python packages**: If you are using specific e-commerce libraries, follow their installation instructions.




### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manish-jsx/django-ecommerce.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project

3. Install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply the database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (an admin user) to manage the application:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Now, you should be able to access the project at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Useful Tasks 


Renaming all folders inside a folder by removing a specific prefix can be achieved through various methods, depending on your operating system. Below are instructions for a few common operating systems:

### Windows Command Prompt:

```bash
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Folder"

for /d %i in ("[StudyMaterial]*") do (
    set "folder=%i"
    ren "!folder!" "!folder:[StudyMaterial]=!"
)
```

Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\Folder"` with the actual path to your folder. This batch script iterates through each folder with the specified prefix and removes that prefix.

### Linux or macOS Terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder

for folder in \[StudyMaterial\]*/; do
    new_folder="${folder/\[StudyMaterial\]/}"
    mv "$folder" "$new_folder"
done
```

Replace `/path/to/your/folder` with the actual path to your folder. This bash script uses a loop to iterate through folders and renames them by removing the specified prefix.

### PowerShell (Windows):

```powershell
cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Folder"

Get-ChildItem -Directory -Filter "[StudyMaterial]*" | ForEach-Object {
    $newName = $_.Name -replace '\[StudyMaterial\]', ''
    Rename-Item $_.FullName -NewName $newName
}
```

Replace `"C:\Path\To\Your\Folder"` with the actual path to your folder. This PowerShell script uses the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get folders and renames them by removing the specified prefix.

Please make sure to back up your data before running such scripts to avoid unintentional data loss. Adjust the paths accordingly and test the script on a small set of folders first to ensure it behaves as expected.



## Troublshooting

It seems like the issue is with how your shell (Zsh in this case) is handling the wildcard pattern. Zsh performs pattern matching on its own, and in this case, it seems to interpret the square brackets in a way that's causing the "no matches found" error.

To resolve this, you can use the `setopt` command to disable the GLOB feature that's causing this behavior. Try running the following commands:

```bash
cd /Users/manishkumar/Downloads/Scrimba\ -\ The\ Frontend\ Developer\ Career\ Path

setopt +o nomatch  # Disable the no-match error
for folder in \[StudyMaterial\]*; do
    new_folder="${folder/\[StudyMaterial\] /}"
    mv "$folder" "$new_folder"
done
```

This should disable the no-match error and allow the script to run as expected. Make sure to replace the path in the `cd` command with the correct path to your "Scrimba - The Frontend Developer Career Path" directory.

If you encounter any further issues, let me know, and we can troubleshoot them.
